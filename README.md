# TotsukaBot
TotsukaBot is a chatbot for whatsapp which send response to particular keywords. This project is originally developing by SomnathDas at https://github.com/SomnathDas/Whatsapp-Botto-Re.git . I just change and add some feature, translate to Bahasa Indonesia also. This is an open-source program written in Javascript. This project require NodeJS v12.
